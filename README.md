#	Warnings	#
#################

#### OpenVZ Containers
--> PeerGuardian, it's not possible to install it in your OpenVZ Container.
```
Module 'xt_mark' is mandatory for PeerGuardian. Currently, I have not found solution. The subject is pending.
```
--> OpenVPN, you must follow this link BEFORE install 'MySB'.
```
https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides/186-how-to-run-access-server-on-a-vps-container.html
```

###### NOTE: You must have a swap partition for systems with less than 2GB of RAM!

	--> Your swap partition should be at least equal to your RAM.

###### NOTE: If you don't know Linux ENOUGH:

	--> DO NOT use capital letters, all your usernames should be written in lowercase.
	--> DO NOT upgrade anything in your box, ask in the thread before even thinking about it.
	--> DO NOT try to reconfigure packages using other tutorials.
	
#################
	
## How to install
Just copy and paste those commands on your terminal:
```
wget --no-check-certificate -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toulousain79/MySB/v1.1/MySB_Install.sh
bash MySB_Install.sh
```

If you lose connection during installation, restart the SSH session and run the following command:
```
screen -r MySB
```
Beware, during installation, the SSH port will be changed. If a port session 22 does not work, try with the new port that you have selected.

###### NOTE 1: You must be logged as root to run this installation or use sudo.
###### NOTE 2: At the end of the installation, the server will restart automatically and you will receive an e-mail summarizing.
###### NOTE 3: The first thing to do once you have received the email, is to add your IPs and change the temporary password.

## How to upgrade from v1.0
Just copy and paste those commands on your terminal:
```
MySB_UpdateGitHubRepo
MySB_UpgradeMe
```

## Commands

After installing you will have access to the following commands to be used directly in terminal.

	* MySB_ChangeUserPassword
	* MySB_CreateUser
	* MySB_DeleteUser
	* MySB_UpdateGitHubRepo (update actual repository)
	* MySB_RefreshMe (refresh some parts of MySB)
	* MySB_UpgradeMe (to migrate to a new version of MySB)
	* MySB_UpgradeSystem (simply upgrade your system APT upgrade)
	
Next scripts are avaible too.
	
	* '/etc/MySB/scripts/BlockList.sh', use this for generate blocklist for rTorrent with 'ipv4_filter.load' command.
	* '/etc/MySB/scripts/FirewallAndSecurity.sh [clean|new]', use this for generate all security options (PeerGuardian, IPtables, Fail2Ban, Nginx IP restricted access, ...)
	* '/etc/MySB/scripts/GetTrackersCert.sh', use this for get all SSL certificates for all tracker avaibled with ruTorrent. You can add more trackers in '/etc/MySB/inc/trackers'.

You can find others scripts in '/etc/MySB/scripts/'. This others scripts are added in cron job.

###### NOTE: While executing them, if sudo is needed, they will ask for a password.

## Services

To access services installed on your new server, point your browser to the following address:
```
https://<Server IP or Server Name>:<https NginX port>/MySB/SeedboxInfo.php
```

## Seedbox-Manager

The seedbox web-manager application is an interface to restart an rtorrent user session. 
It is also not currently: 

	* links to rutorrent and in Cakebox configurable navbar. 
	* a reminder of ids ftp and sftp user. 
	* a support module with deactivatable ticket. 
	* server statistics (load average, uptime). 
	* user information (disk space, visitor IP address). 
	* a tool to generate configuration files filezilla and Transdroid. 
	* a space administrator to easily manage the configuration of your users 
	* A page parameter to disable the blocks you do not use.

```

## BlockList
BlockList usage (optionnal), PeerGuardian or directly via rTorrent.
Depending on your system, it is possible to use: 

#### PeerGuardian

	* By default, some list are activated. Check "/etc/pgl/blocklists.list".
	* Many tracker sites are allowed, but only private trackers. Check "/etc/pgl/allow.p2p".
###### NOTE: Do not try to add your rtorrents ports in the list of incoming ports allowed in PeerGuardian (pglcmd.conf) !!!
###### Using PeerGuardian will not have much sense ...
###### Rather prefer permission trackers via the "allow.p2p" PeerGuardian file. To do this, edit the "/etc/MySB/inc/trackers" file and add only the domain of your tracker.
###### Then use the command "bash /etc/MySB/scripts/GetTrackersCert.sh." This will retrieve all SSL certificates (if available) and complete the list of PeerGuardian.

OR

#### rTorrent with ipv4_filter.load

	* By default, some list are activated. Check "/etc/MySB/inc/blocklist".
	* All list are avaible in "/etc/MySB/inc/blocklist".
	* Comment the line with '#' if you want to exclude a list OR comment out the line with deleting '#' if you want to activate it.
	* Example: #BLUETACK_ADS="http://....." to exclude ADS Bluetack list.	
	* And do "bash /etc/MySB/scripts/BlockList.sh" for generate the new list for each users.

	NB: The script compile one file with all list, and make cleaning rules.
	NB: Beware, if you have not enough memory, choising too many list will make you system very slow!


## OpenVPN

To use your VPN you will need a VPN client compatible with [OpenVPN](http://openvpn.net/index.php?option=com_content&id=357), necessary files to configure your connection are in this link in your box:
```
http://<Server IP or Server Name>:<https NginX port>/MySB/OpenVPN.php` and use it in any OpenVPN client.
```
#### For OpenVZ, you must validate the prerequisites on this page first. Otherwise, OpenVPN will not be functional.
```
https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides/186-how-to-run-access-server-on-a-vps-container.html
```
##### NFS and Samba share with OpenVPN
For NFS, you can mount the /home/<username>/rtorrent like that. The IP address can be different depending on the OpenVPN configuration that you have selected.
```
mount -t nfs [10.0.0.1|10.0.1.1]:/home/<username>/rtorrent <mount_dir> -o  -o nocto,noacl,noatime,nodiratime,nolock,rsize=8192,vers=3,ro,udp
```
For Samba, you can mount the /home/<username> like that. The IP address can be different depending on the OpenVPN configuration that you have selected.
```
mount - <mount_dir> -t cifs -o noatime,nodiratime,UNC=//[10.0.0.1|10.0.1.1]/<username>,username=<username>,password=<your_password>
```

## DNScrypt-proxy
By default, DNScrypt-proxy will use OpenDNS resolver (opendns). 
The full list of DNScrypt resolvers is available at: https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv 

It is possible to change the resolver name at any time using the following command:
```
dnscrypt-proxy service restart <resolver_name>
```

To clean Bind cache, just restart service.

###### 1 - Clean Bind9 cache
```
service bind9 restart
```
###### 2 - Change DNScrypt resolver name
```
service dnscrypt-proxy restart dnscrypt.eu-nl
```

###### IMPORTANT: With OpenVZ container, to complete the installation of DNScrypt-proxy, you must replace your existing DNS config (/etc/resolv.conf), by the loopback address.
###### IMPORTANT: It's necessary to make the change via the host (eg Proxmox), otherwise you will lose your configuration on next reboot. You must replace yours nameserver by 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' (/etc/resolv.conf).

## Supported and tested servers

#### Debian 7 - x86_64 (Wheezy)

	--> Tested on Online.net with "DEDIBOX® SC GEN2" and "DEDIBOX® XC"
	--> Tested on OpenVZ Container with ProxMox, work fine ! (read comment in top of this page)
	--> Tested on OVH with "Kimsufi"
  
#### Ubuntu or older Debian may worked, but not tested...
