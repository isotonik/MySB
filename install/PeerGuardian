#### Create config file

cat <<'EOF'
# pglcmd.conf - configuration file for pglcmd

# This file is sourced by a shell script. Any line which starts with a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. If you set the same variable several times,
# then only the last line will be used.

# Refer to pglcmd.defaults (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pgl/pglcmd.defaults)
# for the complete set of possible configuration variables with comments.

# Do a "pglcmd restart" (sometimes even "reload" is enough) when you have
# edited this file.

# Turn on/off automatic start.
# ignore this on Gentoo
# Note: this tells the init script not to start pgl on "start".
# The same behaviour can be achieved by removing/tweaking the init file and the
# links pointing to it. You can do this manually or by using an application such
# as rcconf.
# 0 - Don't start pgl at system boot
# 1 - Start pgl at system boot
INIT="1"

# Turn on/off automatic blocklist update.
# 0 - Don't update the blocklists automatically
# 1 - Update the blocklists automatically
CRON="1"

# Turn on/off pgld's logging to syslog and/or systemd journal
# 0 - Don't log to syslog/systemd journal
# 1 - Log to syslog/systemd journal
LOG_SYSLOG="1"

# Iptables logging of blocked packets
# Set an iptables target for blocked packets. This will only work if marking
# matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets is on (i.e. REJECT="1").
# The iptables rules will be inserted directly before the iptables rule which
# decides what happens to "marked block" packets.
# Examples:
# "" (empty string): no rule will be inserted
# "LOG --log-level info": blocked packets will be logged to syslog with "info"
#     log level. This allows to find out e.g. the port and to verify if a packet
#     is really blocked and not just "marked block".
LOG_IPTABLES="LOG --log-level info"

# Email the result of the automatic (cron) blocklist update.
# Specify the mail recipient.
# If not set, cron will decide what happens with the output.
CRON_MAILTO=""

# Whitelist ports (traffic on these ports will not be checked)
# Valid values: port numbers or service names. Port ranges are specified in the
# format "port:port".
# Common ports - service names:
#   80 - http
#  443 - https
#   22 - ssh
#  993 - SSL IMAP
# Separate several entries with whitespace (" ")
# Technical implementation: iptables rules in the corresponding iptables chains,
# matching protocol and --sport/dport PORT, target IPTABLES_TARGET_WHITELISTING.
# This section works only for IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1"
# Do a "pglcmd restart" when you have changed these settings.

#### Create Blocklist file

# blocklists.list - lists the blocklists that are handled automatically by pglcmd

# Place one URL per line for every blocklist.
# Any line which starts with a # (hash) is a comment and is ignored.

# Have a look at /usr/share/doc/pglcmd/README.blocklists.gz for detailed
# information about some available blocklists.

# Instead or additionally to the blocklists that are specified in this file,
# you can manually put lists in MASTER_BLOCKLIST_DIR (/var/lib/pgl).
# All blocklists in that directory (except those which end in "~" or have a "."
# prefix) are used by pgld. They may be in any supported format and have to be
# either unpacked or gzipped. Note that these manually installed blocklists are
# neither updated automatically, nore does IP_REMOVE work for them.

# Do a "pglcmd reload" (or "restart" or "update") when you have edited
# this file.
